### Project Description
Using an HR Dashboard guide as inspiration (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcGF09Awm4Y) I developed a dashboard using sample Human Resources data.

The data was generated using the Faker Python library which generates csv datasets with supplied parameters. The file I used was generated using ChatGPT and can be found in the description of the video above. I made some changes, namely removing a department, editing the states, editing some probabilities etc. The generated data was saved as a csv which I then loaded into a Pandas dataframe in a Jupyter notebook to begin some basic exploration of the data. Once completed, I saved the dataframe to an Excel workbook and loaded it into Tableau to create visualizations.
